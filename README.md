Simulation environment which enables research on the properties of objects and physical systems described by linear and non-linear differential equations.

The environment provides the user with a library, which containes examples of dynamic physical systems, control algorithms, filtering algorithms, noise generators, and machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.

In order to ensure the flexibility of the solution, a JSON interface has been designed that allows you to change the parameters of objects and simulations without interfering with the source code of the program.

The environment includes a generator of interactive graphs, which shows selected variables.
